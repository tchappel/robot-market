# Robot Market

This is a e-commerce site for you to buy robots. The homepage should display a list of robots for people to browse,
where on the right side of the screen should display a cart that show a list of selected robots.

Please read the instructions and FAQ below before begin.

The app is optimised for use on desktop only (screen width > 1200px).

## TODO
